# Tasks

## 1. Improve the look and feel of the application

Following things I could achieve:

- Refactor the code to follow general React best practices,
- Write unit tests with jest, enzyme
- Fetch meter readings from [https://storage.googleapis.com/bulb-interview/meterReadingsReal.json](https://storage.googleapis.com/bulb-interview/meterReadingsReal.json),
- Style the application - I did that with [styled-components](http://styled-components.com/) but it can be done in better way

Following things can be improved :

- More unit test can be added
- Components can be styled in even better way
